## 💻 Code: Multi-Model Defect Classification

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for a binary classification task using customer data. It utilizes various ensemble and individual classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more.

### 📁 Dataset (Private)  
Source: [https://lgaimers.ai/](https://lgaimers.ai/)

- `train.csv`: Training dataset containing customer features and a target label (e.g., success/failure of a campaign).
- `submission.csv`: Test dataset with the same structure but without labels, used for generating final predictions.

> 📌 Note: The dataset is proprietary and not publicly available.

### 🧹 Preprocessing

1. **Missing Values Handling**
   - Missing values are filled with 0.
   - An alternative method (backfill) is also included but commented out.

2. **Categorical Data Encoding**
   - Categorical (object) columns are encoded using a custom label encoding function.
   - Optionally, object-type columns can be dropped (code commented out).

### 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning models were used and compared for the classification task:

- `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier)
- `AdaBoostClassifier`
- `GradientBoostingClassifier`
- `XGBClassifier` (XGBoost)
- `SGDClassifier` (Stochastic Gradient Descent)
- `LGBMClassifier` (LightGBM)
- `RandomForestClassifier`
- `LogisticRegression`
- `VotingClassifier` (for ensemble learning)
- Basic `MLP` (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

These models were evaluated to determine the most effective approach for the given dataset.
