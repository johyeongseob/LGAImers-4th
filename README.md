## üíª Code: Multi-Model Defect Classification

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for a binary classification task using customer data. It utilizes various ensemble and individual classifiers such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and more.

### üìÅ Dataset

- `train.csv`: Training dataset including customer features and a target label (e.g., success/failure of a campaign).
- `submission.csv`: Test dataset with the same features but without labels, used for final prediction.

### üßπ Preprocessing

1. **Missing Values Handling**
   - Missing values are filled with 0.
   - An alternative method (backfill) is also included but commented out.

2. **Categorical Data Encoding**
   - Categorical (object) columns are encoded using a custom label encoding function.
   - Optionally, object-type columns can be dropped (code commented out).
